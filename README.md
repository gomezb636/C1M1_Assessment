# Week 1 Assignment: Embedded Software Development

This is the week 1 assessment for the Introduction to Embedded Systems Softwareand Development Environments  course. Objective is to write C functions to perform basic statistical analysis on an array and get familarized with version control.

## Files Included

- `stats.c` – Implementation file containing:
  - Functions to calculate mean, median, min, max
  - Array sorting (largest to smallest)
  - Array and statistics printing
- `stats.h` – Header file with function prototypes and documentation
- `README.md` – Description of project and instructions for execution

## Features

- Calculates and displays:
  - Minimum value
  - Maximum value
  - Mean
  - Median
- Sorts array from largest to smallest
- Clean modular structure with reusable code
- Uses `printf` to output results clearly

## How to Build

Use any C compiler (like `gcc`):

```bash
gcc stats.c -o stats
./stats
```

## Using Git

To view my commits, view the git log by running the following command
```
git log
```

You can also clone my repository from GitHub using the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/gomezb636/C1M1_Assessment.git
```
